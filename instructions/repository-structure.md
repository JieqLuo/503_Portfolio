# Repository structure

There are several directories created for you (with empty files so they get comitted). Please do not alter the structure.

* `css/`: any `css` files you will use

* `data/`: your data files (both raw and processed). Remember that `GitHub` will only accept files smaller than 10MB. If your files are larger, you will need to install [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) and read the documentation to learn how to set it up 

* `instructions/`: these instructions

* `js/`: all your `javascript` files
